# (Milestone Project 2)

* Simple memory game

## User Stories

### New Site Users

* As a new site user, I would like to be able to quickly and easily understand what the game.

* As a new site user, I would like to be able to easily find instructions on how to play and that they are clear.

* As a new site user, I would like to see the score during my games and that my high score stays where I can see it.

### Returning Site Users

* As a returning site user, I would like that my high score is saved in the memory so that I can try and beat it another time. 

## Design

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created on balsamiq for mobile, tablet and desktop displays.

## Credits

* Finding [this page](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_html_nodelist.asp) on W3 Schools that informed me that a nodelist is not an array.

### Code Used From Outside Sources

* I initially used code from [this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/comments/jkv7lo/put_div_elements_in_array/) to help me when I was initially struggling to iterate through my cards. But changed it later.

* I used code from [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29116240/create-an-array-from-ids-from-divs) to help me get my card IDs into an array.

* I used code from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0MxUHlZo6U&t=1450s) by Web Dev Cody to help with getting random IDs.

* I used code from [Geeks for Geeks (Method 2)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-compare-two-arrays-in-javascript/) for having precisely what I needed to help me write some simple array comparing code.

* I used code from [this Simon game example](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-simon-game-using-html-css-javascript/) from Geeks for Geeks for my playSequence function that I was struggling on.
